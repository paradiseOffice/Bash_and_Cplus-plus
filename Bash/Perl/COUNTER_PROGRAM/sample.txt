The Internet is a collection of thousands of computers that
communicate through certain methods that have been agreed
on for many years. The Internet started about 25 years ago
with a small handful of computers run by a few people as an
experiment. The initial results were successful; the
network was useful, so it grew.
In fact, the Internet was partially intended to be an
experiment for how to design a network that could grow
easily, with very little central control. That concept is
still considered radical today, and you find few networks
as loose as the Internet.
